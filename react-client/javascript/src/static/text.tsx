        I've found that most disagreement can be attributed to unclear expectations and definitions of success.\
        Our mutual investment in this process does wonders to eliminate ambiguity in both the adventure and the final result.",

            The more we invest here, the fewer ambiguities remain, and the happier everyone is with the final product.\
            This is where we set expectations for the project phases, timeline, scope, and budget.\
            If we decide that we're a good fit for each other, we can go ahead and set a start date with the project.\
            It's important that neither party feels tied into the other simply because of the mutual time investment.",

            I've never seen this happen in practice. Designs change, things end up being technically impossible, time tables move, etc.\
            Weekly meetings help continuously clarify problems and establish solutions that emerge during the development process.",

            I use conclusion to define the end of new work for a specific phase.\
            We both need to happy with the work done in the phase for it to be complete.\
            Lastly, I schedule a retrospective to reflect on what went well and what we need to improve on."
